Share the blue link to invite guests who will join the chat automatically.\n<br><br>\n<font style=\"color:red\">Known Limitations with Group Rooms:</font><br>\n<li>A group room can handle up to around 30 guests, depending on numerous factors, including CPU and available bandwidth of all guests in the room. To achieve more than around 7-guests though, you will likely want to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpRa8-UYCGc\" title=\"Youtube Video demoing how to do this\">disable video sharing between guests</a>. Using &amp;broadcast, &amp;roombitrate=0 or &amp;novideo are options there.</li>\n\n<li>Videos will appear of low quality on purpose for guests and director; this is to save bandwidth and CPU resources. It will be high-quality within OBS still though.</li>\n\n<li>The state of the scenes, such as which videos are active in a scene, are lost when the director resets the control-room or the scene.</li>\n<br>\nFurther Notes:<br><br>\n<li>Links to Solo-views of each guest video are offered under videos as they load. These can be used within an OBS Browser Source.</li>\n<li>You can use the auto-mixing Group Scenes, the green links, to auto arrange multiple videos for you in OBS.</li>\n<li>You can use this control room to record isolated video or audio streams, but it is an experimental feature still.</li>\n<li>If you transfer a guest from one room to another, they won't know which room they have been transferred to.</li>\n<li>OBS will see a guest's video in high-quality; the default video bitrate is 2500kbps. Setting higher bitrates will improve motion.</li>\n<li>VP8 is typically the default video codec, but using &amp;codec=vp9 or &amp;codec=h264 as a URL in OBS can help to reduce corrupted video puke issues.</li>\n<li>&amp;stereo=2 can be added to guests to turn off audio effects, such as echo cancellation and noise-reduction.</li>\n<li>https://invite.cam is a free service provided that can help obfuscuate the URL parameters of an invite link given to guests.</li>\n<li>Adding &amp;showonly=SOME_OBS_VIRTUALCAM to the guest invite links allows for only a single video to be seen by the guests; this can be output of the OBS Virtual Camera for example</li>\n<br>\n\nFor advanced URL options and parameters, <a href=\"https://docs.vdo.ninja/advanced-settings\">see the Wiki.</a>\n",
